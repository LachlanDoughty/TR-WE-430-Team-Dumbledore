            <p> The vast world of Information Technology has always mesmerized me to a great extent and has also led me to delve into how it could shape the future. The flexibility offered through IT careers are quite promising as they are designed to cater for the growing needs of the consumers as well as the latest advancements in the world of technology. Although I have not got any solid experience in this field, but I do feel that this is something that I have always wanted to do and pursue as my career.</p>

            <p> Nothing brings people together like great food, hence why I love to cook. I absolutely love to explore different cuisines and dishes from all around the world. Cooking creates a culture of giving and receiving positive energy to the people around us, which is why it acts as a form of meditation for me.</p>

            <p> I am not that good at programming therefore my aim in this project would be to enhance my programming skills. This is because IT mainly evolves around different programs, therefore developing a good grasp of different programming languages can help one develop intuitive apps that the whole world relies upon.</p>

            <p> Most of my team members genuinely believe that they need to improve their programming skills. Programming is one unique and a challenging language which takes a good amount of time for one to grasp a good understanding off. Therefore, the aim behind this project is to not only provide the most desirable user experience to the users but to also enhance and uplift our programming skills.</p>

            <p> My challenge would be to finish this project in the time frame provided and to a top-notch quality. It is crucial that we as a group fulfill the requirements to the best of our ability and provide desirable outcome upon the completion of this IT project.</p> 

            <p> The specific types of tasks that I see myself contributing to the team includes helping my team during the design and development stages which basically includes creating detailed prototypes, writing a description about what the app will entail and developing the app itself.

            <p> When I look at my skill set as a whole, I think my weaknesses is programming. I am planning on brushing up this semester to broaden my skill set, I have selected programming 1 to improve my skills in programming. I would love to gain various types of knowledge in programming and app developing.</p>
                
            <p> The challenges that we will be facing would be developing the app, as most of us do not have any sort of experience in building an app however I trust that our team will put in tremendous effort and reach the best possible outcome.</p>
            
            <p> The challenges I would be facing would be developing a website or an application and presenting in the best way possible, however I believe that if we work as a team we would easily be able to achieve our goals.</p>
            
            <p>I see myself contributing to the team by understanding and supporting the team to achieve the end goal, I would also contribute by understanding roles of others and collaborating with them more successfully.

            <p> I am an international student from India studying IT at RMIT University and I basically belong to Punjabi culture. My family lives in India and I arrived here in Melbourne last month. I have completed my grade 12th in Non-medical stream where my main subjects were Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. I have studied very little about HTML in my 10th grade because of which I am here today pursuing my career in IT. And because of my multi-cultured country, I can speak three languages which are English, Hindi, and Punjabi. My biggest dream is to explore the world and enjoy the beauty of nature all over the globe. I have a huge passion for fashion trends and I love to try them out too. I have done modeling, anchoring, and singing in my high school. I love to participate in different activities. My hobbies include hairstyling and poetry writing. </p>

            <p> I am a very good learner as I love to learn new and innovative things that I could also implement in real life. I also have the ability to work individually as well as with a group.</p>
            
            <p> I have learned to create web pages using HTML in the previous semester and I have found that I am pretty good at it.</p> 
            
            <p> According to me, the huge challenge is to implement all the ideas perfectly into our project in a clear and sophisticated way. </p>

            <p> Contribution: I am really good at managing multiple things and I think this will help all the group members as well.</p>

            <p>  I have lived in Melbourne’s southeast for most of my life, I did not know what I wanted to do for my career until I talked to some friends who are in the IT industry and was intrigued. I have been studying at RMIT since 2018 doing an advance diploma in computer systems engineering, I decided that I wanted to continue my knowledge and do a Bachelor of Information Technology. I love a challenge and as IT is so diverse, there is always something new that you can learn. </p>

            <p> I enjoy working as part of a team, I have some experience with networking, cisco CCNA routing and switching, windows server 2016 and windows 10, Linux desktop and server and web development. I am very interested in Cybersecurity, I would like to do a master’s in Cybersecurity after this course if I can, but if not I would love to work in an IT department for a global organization that would allow me to travel.</p>

            <p> The areas that I could improve in the time managing, it’s an easy thing to fix but in the current situations with Covid-19 I am finding it a little hard. I would love to develop some knowledge and skills in developing an application, and working as a team to tackle something that most of us have not had any experiences in.</p>

            <p> The team seems like they are challenged in the same areas that I am, we don’t have much if any skills or knowledge in developing an application. I believe we have a strong team that will be putting in the effort to achieve and complete as much of our application as we can!</p>

            <p> The challengers will be building the application itself and the implementing of the features into our application.</p>

            <p> I see myself doing some of the programming and web development for our group project, and I will assist any member of the team if they request. </p>

            <p> I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Australia back in 2016. I have had a strong passion for Information Technology since I was a kid which is why I studied IT in high school. At that time, I decided that I am going to study IT in the future. I love how everything revolves around IT these days. IT gives us a chance to create our virtual world and I would like to create my own. So that I can bring my thoughts into reality.</p>

            <p> I am interested in cybersecurity as we all know it is one of the pillars of technology these days and it will be the main aspect of IT in the future. By keeping this in mind, I am also studying Certificate IV in cybersecurity so I can pursue my career in cybersecurity in the coming days. Apart from this, I like to play cricket as it teaches how teamwork, leadership, and patience leads us to success.</p>

            <p> My programming skills could be improved a lot as I know from now on until the end of the degree there will be a lot of subjects which will require a high level of programming. Therefore, my main aim of this project will be to polish my programming skills in a way to help me in other subjects.</p>

            <p> As most of us are new to this field, we all are facing similar problems. Therefore, we will try to help each other as much as we can and to challenge all of us to the best of our abilities. We will work all together however we’ll split in different paths to be more efficient and effective.</p>

            <p> In a project, many factors need to be done but the main challenge would be dividing tasks equally among the team. Additionally, I want to contribute more towards the designing and coding side but mainly I want to work as a part of a team.</p>

            <p> I want to contribute as much as I can as there are many factors that need to be done. I see myself leading my team successfully creating a website from scratch. I know it’s difficult but not impossible. </p>

            <p> My interest in IT stems from both my occupation as an Army Signals Officer and curiosity for programming and computer hardware. As a teenager I always had an interest in gaming and computers; I dabbled in HTML coding at school but never really developed my skills further. My experience thus far is limited to basic skills and knowledge of communications and information systems that I have gained through courses facilitated through the Defence Force and first year Bachelor of IT subjects</p> 
            
            <p>I believe that my strengths lie more toward the programming and coding side of things, having some experience in Java, Python and HTML coding through previous subjects. However, I would consider myself very much a novice in these areas.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, through my Army experience, I have a basic understanding of information management practices and cyber security strategies. Additionally, due to my position as an Officer and having time in command of soldiers, I have a great deal of organisational leadership and management experience. Through my training I have also gained some technical understanding of networks and information systems and the ability to communicate to superiors, subordinates and peers at both the technical and non-technical level.</p>
            
            <p>Noting that almost all of us have very limited programming skills I believe our common weakness will be in developing the features of our project. However, with determination and the right attitude I am confident we will overcome this weakness and all learn in the process.</p>
            
            <p>As a result of our teams’ lack of programming experience I believe the greatest challenge that we will face will be transitioning our ideas into tangible outputs that we can demonstrate with successful functionality.</p>
            
            <p>I expect that I will contribute more on the technical aspects of the projects in developing HTML code for our website and attempting to develop the features using other coding languages such as Java, Python or any of the C varieties.</p>

  <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>Our motivation behind the Slim & Fit app came from the fact that the pandemic has seized away all the opportunities from the young youth and the elderly to live a life of their choice. Therefore, this thought in mind triggered the idea that we should create a fitness and health related app that is able to help and cater for everyone’s need, especially in this time of life. This app would be the most perfect app for the health-conscious people who want to still pursue with their fitness and health related goals despite the pandemic.</p> 

      <p>We are all self-driven to look after ourselves, especially during the pandemic when we are surrounded by complete isolation. The aim of creating this fitness related app is so we can raise awareness amongst the generation that despite what situation you are surrounded by there is no excuse to neglect your health and wellbeing. By creating this app, we will definitely be going above and beyond our current IT knowledge as we will learn and explore new things in each of the stages from the designing stage, all the way to the evaluation stage. We as a group will enrich our IT skills in different areas such as designing, programming, communication and writing skills. </p>

      <p> We did not use our IT idea from last semester, but we were inspired from our project that we did in UCD. As a group we merged the two themes together, which included fitness and health and thus came up with the idea to create Fit and Slim. This app is the most perfect app as it considers the current situation and how people are unable to go gyms and look after themselves in this lockdown. Although our UCD project was not that advanced and we have just used that as a foundation to build upon the project. We have added some incredible and advanced features such as         which acts as an incentive to motivation the youth and the elderly to look after themselves all the time despite of the current situation. </p>
      
      <h2>Project Justification</h2>
      <h3> Justified Workload </h3>

      <p>Each of us has limited skills at this stage in developing websites, applications and coding. As such, creating and implementing many of the features we intend to for this project will be a challenging endeavour for all of us. For the first half of the project the majority of our workload will be dedicated to developing our own personal skills required to create the features of our project. However, in the latter half of the project we will have all gained a lot of experience and skills and be able to devote our time more efficiently to generating outcomes and features that will ensure the success of our product.</p>
      
      <h2> Beyond Current Capabilities </h2> 
      
      <p>There is a general consensus amongst the team members of this group that we all have a weakness in the area of coding, programming and website development; with each of us only possessing basic skills at best that we have developed in previous university IT subjects. Therefore, it is clear that the development of the HTML website and the features we intend to implement will challenge all of us a great deal.</p>
  

      <p>Throughout the development of this project we will distribute the workload in such a way that all of us are equally challenged and required to acquire new skills and knowledge to be successful. For all of us the coding and technical side of things will immediately put us out of comfort zones and to overcome this we will work together and learn from each other to meet our project goals.</p>

      <h2>Project Risks </h2>

      <h3>Account creation </h3>

      <p>One of the greatest risks to our project being successful will be the correct implementation and management of account creation. If we are not able to successfully deliver this feature then we will not be able to tailor our product to individuals and will the functionality of a great deal other features. In order to mitigate this, the creation of accounts and the associated log in functions will be a priority task that will implanted early on and tested rigorously </p>

      <h3>Relevant content </h3>
      
      <p>As part of our project we will aim to provide our users with health and fitness specific content that is beneficial and of interest to them. To ensure that the content we provide is relevant and engaging for all types of users we will require some sort of survey or screening process upon initial account creation. For example, asking the user about their age, dietary preferences, fitness level, goals, etc will then enable us to provide the most relevant and tailored content for the individual user, maximising user satisfaction. </p>

      <h3>Gamification of our service </h3>
      
      <p>As part of our project, we intend to track a user’s progress and allow them to set goals and targets to work toward, and then be rewarded appropriately for meeting their goals. This poses a risk in finding the balance of offering users with realistic and meaningful goals that are also challenging for them, while also having a reward function that incentivises and motivates users to achieve these goals. </p>

      <h2>Team Dynamic Risks </h2>

      <h3>Skill level</h3> 
      
      <p> Across the board, we as a team lack technical experience and skills in the use of programming languages for website and application development. As such, this poses a major risk to the success of our team in being able to deliver our features in a timely manner. We will overcome this risk through personal development in the initial phases and a high level of cooperation to work through our technical challenges together. </p>

      <h3> Differing ideas </h3>
      
      <p>As a team, we all come from a very diverse background and have unique experiences. This means that we all look to solve problems in vastly different ways and sometimes our ideas can clash. The risk here is that we fail to effectively communicate and collaborate and our project could end up diverging from its initial trajectory. In order to combat this risk we meet regularly and all maintain an open and collaborative mindset that will enable us to take the best parts of all our ideas and merge them together. </p>

      <h3>Uncertainty </h3>
      <p>The theme of 2020 appears to be that the only certain thing is absolute uncertainty. All of us have busy schedules and a range of competing priorities such as caring for family and dependents or working full time. Because of this, there will be periods of uncertainty where team members are unable to communicate and work together effectively when they are required to attend to other matters. The best mitigation strategy to overcome this is to maintain an open mind as a team, be understanding of members’ personal circumstances and adopt a flexible approach to the project.</p>

      <h2>Group Contract

</h2>
	  
    
<p>
Our core expectations and rules are made very clear to everyone in the group. Based upon our mutual understanding and expectations, we have decided to meet twice every week for 15 to 20 min. One of the meetings would be set earlier in the week and the other would be closer to the end of the week. This will give each member a sufficient time to finish their set tasks and report it back to the group for further discussions and feedback. Everyone is required to attend the meeting and for some reason, if they are unable to do so, they should inform the group prior to the meeting to avoid any mishaps or confusion. One of the most crucial expectations based upon our group is that we should record our meetings on Microsoft Teams each week, with our audio and video enabled. This is because face-to-face meetings allow for clearer communication and provides a great level of professionalism which is one of the fundamentals of working in a team project. </p>

Ground Rules for the meeting.

<p>Everyone in the group is fully aware of their tasks and responsibilities within this group project. We have embedded a very positive and pleasant culture within our group which means that all our team members are constantly supporting each other and seeking help if they require. We as a group are always encouraging and offering support to each other so that nobody feels overburdened or stressed about their designated tasks. Our deadlines are made very clear in the group channel and everyone respects those deadlines. </p>
      
<p>Everyone in the group is respectful and responsible and knows about the requirements and expectations expected off them. However, if we do ever have to deal with unmet expectations, the process is quite simple. The two disputed parties can sit together and endeavour to sort out any misunderstandings or grudges against one and other. Usually this step would solve the unexpected issues and concerns, however, if it still does not get resolved then the issue can be brought before a tutor in their own time outside the group meetings.</p>

<p>An agreed-upon method for peer feedback during the project so that problems can be addressed is that during our tutorial session and the two meetings during the week, each member will present what they have done so far and will receive insightful and thoughtful feedback in order to improve. No one in the group will ever be patronized or judged upon their respective contribution. The aim of this session is to provide as much support to each other as possible so that as a team we can succeed in this project.</p>

<p>The expected frequency of responses is 24 hours and all our team members are very responsive and usually reply within few hours. However, if for some reason they are unable to do so, they can just reply when they can as we do understand that there could be personal issues that one can get caught up with.</p>

<p>For this IT project, our group uses various tools and resources to communicate such as Microsoft Teams and Trello. We often also make use of google.docs to enable sharing amongst the group easier and faster.  
    Ground Rules for the meeting.</p>
